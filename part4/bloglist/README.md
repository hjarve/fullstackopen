## dependencies
express:  library that aims to provide a better abstraction for general use cases we usually require to build a backend server

cors: We can allow requests from other origins by using Node's cors middleware

jest: unit testing
cross-env: makes mode specification of the app to work on Windows (cross-platform compatibility)
supertest: package that helps to write tests for testing the API
